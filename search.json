    "title": "Is Arch Manning Really Worth The Hype?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Arch Manning continues to be one of the most discussed young quarterbacks in college football, largely due to his last name and the expectations surrounding him. Manning’s actual on-field results paint a more grounded picture. He’s had moments where he looks like he’s improving, but he still ranks around the middle compared to the rest of the SEC quarterbacks. His stats show a player who’s growing and learning, with decent decision-making but plenty of room to sharpen his game as he gets more reps. At the end of the day, his last name carries most of the hype because the numbers don’t quite match the buzz around him.\nWhen you look past the hype and break Arch Manning down by the numbers, a clearer picture starts to form. Arch isn’t carrying Texas, but he isn’t dragging them down either. The table shows where Arch ranks among the SEC’s top 10 quarterbacks across key efficiency metrics like yards per game, completion percentage, etc. And the takeaway is pretty simple. Arch consistently lands right in the middle.\nHe’s not touching the conference leaders like Joey Aguilar or Ty Simpson, who push the SEC’s top end in yards and touchdown percentage. But he’s also nowhere near the bottom in the categories that signal real problems, like turnovers or low completion rates. Arch essentially blends into the pack.\nThis is important context for evaluating Texas’s offense overall. The numbers suggest that Arch isn’t the reason Texas thrives, but he also isn’t the reason they struggle. He’s solid, steady, and fine, but obviously not exceptional. And seeing that in this conference, where great quarterbacks play often makes the difference between “fine” and “great”, and fine doesn’t cut it.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nfootball &lt;- read_csv(\"footballseasons.csv\")\n\nTouch &lt;- football |&gt; filter(TD &gt;=18)\n\nTouchdowns &lt;- Touch |&gt;\n  group_by(Player, Conf) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    Touchdowns = sum(TD),\n    Yards = sum(Yds)) |&gt;\n  filter(Conf == \"SEC\")\n\nnew &lt;- Touch |&gt;\n  group_by(Player, Conf) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    Touchdowns = sum(TD),\n    Interceptions = sum(Int)) |&gt;\n  filter(Conf == \"SEC\")\n\ntable &lt;- read_csv(\"2025Table.csv\")\n\ntable |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    Player = \"Player\",\n    Team = \"Team\",\n    `Yards Per Game` = \"Yards/Game\",\n    `Completion %` = \"Completion %\",\n    `Touchdown %` = \"TD %\",\n    Interceptions = \"Interceptions\") |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"SEC's Top 10 Quarterbacks: Arch isn't bad but isn't good.\",\n    subtitle = \"Highlighting that Arch's numbers fall between the conference standouts and strugglers in the Top 10. \"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Shaylin Kucera  |  **Source:** Sports Reference\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#bf5700\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player == \"Arch Manning\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color=\"green\", weight = \"normal\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`Yards Per Game`),\n      rows = `Yards Per Game` &gt; 300\n    )) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color=\"green\", weight = \"normal\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`Completion %`),\n      rows = `Completion %` &gt; 69.9\n    ) ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color=\"green\", weight = \"normal\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`Touchdown %`),\n      rows = `Touchdown %` &gt; 7.4\n    )) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color=\"green\", weight = \"normal\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(Interceptions),\n      rows = Interceptions &gt; 7\n    )) |&gt;\ntab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color=\"red\", weight = \"normal\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`Yards Per Game`),\n      rows = `Yards Per Game` &lt; 224\n    )) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color=\"red\", weight = \"normal\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`Completion %`),\n      rows = `Completion %` &lt; 62.4\n    ) ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color=\"red\", weight = \"normal\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(`Touchdown %`),\n      rows = `Touchdown %` &lt; 4\n    )) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color=\"red\", weight = \"normal\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(Interceptions),\n      rows = Interceptions &lt; 2\n    ))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEC's Top 10 Quarterbacks: Arch isn't bad but isn't good.\n\n\nHighlighting that Arch's numbers fall between the conference standouts and strugglers in the Top 10.\n\n\nPlayer\nTeam\nYards/Game\nCompletion %\nTD %\nInterceptions\n\n\n\n\nJoey Aguilar\nTennessee\n304.1\n65.7\n7.1\n8\n\n\nTy Simpson\nAlabama\n273.4\n66.9\n7.1\n1\n\n\nDiego Pavia\nVanderbilt\n244.0\n70.0\n7.7\n5\n\n\nTaylen Green\nArkansas\n263.6\n62.4\n6.9\n8\n\n\nTrinidad Chambliss\nOle Miss\n235.6\n64.0\n4.9\n2\n\n\nBlake Shapen\nMississippi State\n223.4\n65.2\n5.6\n6\n\n\nMarcel Reed\nTexas A&M\n243.7\n62.3\n7.5\n6\n\n\nArch Manning\nTexas\n235.9\n62.7\n6.7\n6\n\n\nGunner Stockton\nGeorgia\n226.7\n69.4\n5.8\n2\n\n\nJohn Mateer\nOklahoma\n243.6\n63.8\n3.0\n7\n\n\n\nBy: Shaylin Kucera | Source: Sports Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking into Arch Manning’s passing performance to hundreds of quarterbacks across the 2024 and 2025 seasons, again he’s in the middle. Every light grey point represents a QB from 2024, while the darker grey points mark 2025. Arch is highlighted with two dots, red for his 2024 season and orange for 2025. The movement between them tells the story.\nIn 2024, Arch sat on the lower end of both passing yards per game and completions. However, in 2025, he shifts noticeably upward and to the right, signaling a meaningful improvement. He’s still not among the elite cluster at the top of the graph, but the jump shows he’s trending in the right direction compared to the rest of the field.\n\n\nCode\nFB24 &lt;- football |&gt; filter(Year == 2024)\n\nFB25 &lt;- football |&gt; filter(Year == 2025)\n\nCompletions24 &lt;- FB24 |&gt; filter(Cmp &gt;= 50)\n\nCompletions25 &lt;- FB25 |&gt; filter(Cmp &gt;= 50)\n\nArch24 &lt;- football |&gt; filter(Player == \"Arch Manning*\")\n\nArch25 &lt;- football |&gt; filter(Player == \"Arch Manning\")\n\nOverallCmp24 &lt;- Completions24 |&gt;\n  group_by(Player, Conf) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    Interceptions = sum(Int),\n    Completions = sum(Cmp),\n    Games = sum(G)) |&gt;\n  filter(Conf == \"SEC\")\n\nOverallCmp25 &lt;- Completions25 |&gt;\n  group_by(Player, Conf) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    Interceptions = sum(Int),\n    Completions = sum(Cmp),\n    Games = sum(G)) |&gt;\n  filter(Conf == \"SEC\")\n\nArch24Cmp &lt;- Arch24 |&gt;\n  group_by(Player, Conf) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    Interceptions = sum(Int),\n    Completions = sum(Cmp),\n    Games = sum(G)) |&gt;\n  filter(Conf == \"SEC\")\n\nArch25Cmp &lt;- Arch25 |&gt;\n  group_by(Player, Conf) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    Interceptions = sum(Int),\n    Completions = sum(Cmp),\n    Games = sum(G)) |&gt;\n  filter(Conf == \"SEC\")\n\nseason24 &lt;- football |&gt; filter(Year == 2024)\nseason25 &lt;- football |&gt; filter(Year == 2025)\n\nggplot() +\ngeom_point(data=season24, aes(x = `Y/G`, y = `Cmp%`), color=\"lightgrey\") + \ngeom_point(data=season25, aes(x = `Y/G`, y = `Cmp%`), color=\"darkgrey\") + \ngeom_point(data = filter(football, Player == \"Arch Manning\"), \n                    aes(x = `Y/G`, y = `Cmp%`),\n                    color=\"#bf5700\", size=5) + \n  geom_point(data = filter(football, Player == \"Arch Manning*\"),\n             aes(x=`Y/G`, y = `Cmp%`),\n             color=\"red\", size=5) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Arch Manning's Passing Game Compared to the Competition\",\n    subtitle=\"Highlighting Arch's improvement from his 2024 to 2025 season and his place among other QBs.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By: Shaylin Kucera\",\n    x= \"Passing Yards Per Game\", \n    y= \"Pass Completions\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=11), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow to compare Arch Manning to 13 other quarterbacks by looking at one of the simplest measures of passing efficiency. How many touchdowns a quarterback throws compared to how often he gives the ball away. Each line shows a quarterback’s interceptions on the left (red) and touchdowns on the right (green), giving a quick visual of the gap between good and bad outcomes.\nQuarterbacks with long gaps like Quinn Ewers, Garret Nussmeier, and Carson Beck are the ones producing points without making many mistakes. Arch Manning, however, sits in the middle of the chart with a shorter gap. He isn’t turning the ball over at an alarming rate, but he isn’t producing touchdowns at the level of the top SEC passers either.\nThe takeaway is straightforward. Arch is average but steady and plays it safe. He avoids disaster, but he’s not generating the explosive scoring numbers that separate elite quarterbacks from everyone else.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=new,\n    aes(y=reorder(Player,Interceptions), x=Interceptions, xend=Touchdowns),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"red\",\n    colour_xend = \"green\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Interceptions vs. Touchdowns\",\n    y=\"Player\",\n    title=\"Arch Manning vs. 13 Other Quarterbacks: TD vs. INT\",\n    subtitle=\"Comparing pass efficiency with touchdown and interception gaps, Arch is looking average.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By: Shaylin Kucera\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size=11),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, Arch Manning’s performance reflects a quarterback who is progressing but has not yet reached the elite status that people say he has. Manning’s efficiency and output put him somewhere in the middle, not one of the SEC’s stars, but not someone who fades into the background either. He generally avoids big mistakes and has shown steady improvement, which points to real potential down the road. He’s not a dominant presence yet, but his development suggests he could grow into a bigger role for Texas as he gains experience. Maybe with time, he’ll live up to the hype that comes with his last name."

    "title": "Does Running Make a Better Quarterback?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The quarterback role in the NFL has shifted a ton over the past decade. It’s not just about classic pocket passers anymore. Teams are leaning into quarterbacks who can actually move, guys who extend plays, escape pressure, and pick up yards when everything breaks down. Players like Lamar Jackson, Jalen Hurts, and Josh Allen have basically changed what people expect from the position. Defenses can’t just worry about the throw anymore; they have to account for the run game coming straight from the quarterback.\nThe shift brings up a pretty big question: Does running actually make a quarterback better, or is it just something that looks cool on Sundays? When you look at today’s top quarterbacks, the difference in how much they rely on their legs is obvious. Some use rushing as a huge part of their game, while others only run when they absolutely have to. Then you’ve got the more traditional passers who barely take off at all. Seeing those differences makes it clear that mobility can change how an offense works. Whether it’s turning broken plays into first downs or just creating more things for a defense to worry about, the ability to run definitely adds something extra to the position.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nqb &lt;- read_csv(\"2024passing.csv\")\nqbrush &lt;- read_csv(\"2024rushing.csv\")\n\nqb24rush &lt;- qbrush |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Pos == \"QB\"\n  )\n\ntop22attempts &lt;- qb |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Att &gt;= 361\n  ) \n\ntop10 &lt;- top22attempts |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Rk &lt;= 10\n  )\n\nbarrush &lt;- qb24rush |&gt;\n  filter(\n    G &gt;= 16,\n    Yds &gt;=270\n  )\n\nLamar &lt;- barrush |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Player == \"Lamar Jackson\"\n  ) \n\nJoshAllen &lt;- read_csv(\"JoshAllen.csv\")\nLamarJackson &lt;- read_csv(\"LamarJackson.csv\")\nKylerMurray &lt;- read_csv(\"KylerMurray.csv\")\nJalenHurts &lt;- read_csv(\"JalenHurts.csv\")\nJaydenDaniels &lt;- read_csv(\"JaydenDaniels.csv\")\n\nTopYA &lt;- bind_rows(JoshAllen,LamarJackson,KylerMurray,JalenHurts,JaydenDaniels)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=barrush, aes(x=reorder(Player,Yds), weight= Yds)) +\n  geom_bar(data=Lamar, aes(x=reorder(Player,Yds), weight=Yds), fill=\"#241773\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title=\"The NFL's Top Rushing Quarterbacks Are Creating a Huge Gap\",\n    subtitle=\"In the 2024 season only a handful of quarterbacks are consistently putting up major rushing numbers, \\nLamar Jackson and Jayden Daniels finishing far ahead of the rest.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Shaylin Kucera\",\n    x=\"\",\n    y=\"Rushing Yards (Regular Season)\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size=11),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning quarterbacks change everything about how an offense works. When a QB can take off and actually be a threat on the ground, defenses have to account for way more than just the passing game. It opens up space, forces linebackers to hesitate, and turns broken plays into big gains.\nOver the last few seasons, we’ve seen more quarterbacks lean into that dual-threat role, not just scrambling, but being designed runners who can pick up first downs and finish drives. And the guys who run the most aren’t just padding stats. They’re creating real scoring opportunities and keeping defenses constantly off balance. Looking at the top rushing quarterbacks in the league, it’s clear that mobility isn’t just a bonus anymore; it’s becoming a real part of what makes an offense dangerous.\n\n\n\nCode\nnewqbrush &lt;- qb24rush |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Yds &gt;= 100\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    YdsPerAtt = Yds/Att\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=JoshAllen, aes(x=Week, y=`Y/A`, color=Player)) +\n  geom_line(data=JalenHurts, aes(x=Week, y=`Y/A`, color=Player)) +\n  geom_line(data=JaydenDaniels, aes(x=Week, y=`Y/A`, color=Player)) +\n  geom_line(data=KylerMurray, aes(x=Week, y=`Y/A`, color=Player)) +\n  geom_line(data=LamarJackson, aes(x=Week, y=`Y/A`, color=Player)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.0,21.8)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"#004C54\", \"#FFB612\", \"#00338D\",\"#97233F\",\"purple\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title=\"How Consistently Do Quarterbacks Create Big Rushing Plays?\",\n    subtitle=\"Weekly rushing yards per attempt show how often top dual-threat quarterbacks turn their carries into \\nexplosive gains during the regular season.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Shaylin Kucera\",\n    x=\"Week (Regular Season)\",\n    y=\"Rushing Yards Per Attempt\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size=11),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother thing that really stands out with mobile quarterbacks is how efficiency and opportunity usually rise together. When a quarterback consistently picks up yards on the field, coaches start trusting those runs and read-option looks a lot more. It’s basically a feedback loop; the more effective they are, the more attempts they get, and the more attempts they get, the more they shape the rhythm of the offense.\nYou can also see how certain QBs separate themselves by turning their rushing role into something sustainable instead of just a last-second scramble. It shows that players aren’t just athletic, but actually skilled runners with timing, patience, and real player-making instincts. As the league keeps shifting toward valuing versatility, quarterbacks who can produce aren’t just extensions of the run game but reliable engines behind it.\n\n\nCode\nscattertd &lt;- qb24rush |&gt;\n  filter(\n    G &gt;= 15\n  )\n\nrushlabels &lt;- qb24rush |&gt; filter(Player == \"Lamar Jackson\" | Player == \"Jalen Hurts\" | Player == \"Jayden Daniels\" | Player == \"Anthony Richardson\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=qb24rush, aes(x=`Y/G`, y=`A/G`)) +\n  geom_point(data = filter(qb24rush, Player == \"Lamar Jackson\"), \n                    aes(x = `Y/G`, y = `A/G`),\n                    color=\"#241773\", size=3) +\n  geom_point(data = filter(qb24rush, Player == \"Jalen Hurts\"), \n                    aes(x = `Y/G`, y = `A/G`),\n                    color=\"#004C54\", size=3) +\n  geom_point(data = filter(qb24rush, Player == \"Jayden Daniels\"), \n                    aes(x = `Y/G`, y = `A/G`),\n                    color=\"#5A1414\", size=3) +\n  geom_point(data = filter(qb24rush, Player == \"Anthony Richardson\"), \n                    aes(x = `Y/G`, y = `A/G`),\n                    color=\"#002C5F\", size=3) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=rushlabels, aes(x=`Y/G`, y=`A/G`, label=Player)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n    labs(\n    title = \"Do Quarterbacks Who Run More...

Some guys use their legs as a constant threat that forces defenses to account for them on every snap. Others might not run as often, but when they do, it’s usually in high-leverage moments like third-downs, red-zone plays, or late-game drives where one big rush can flip everything. And then you have quarterbacks who combine steady yardage with the ability to finish plays in the end zone, which adds a whole extra layer to an offense. It shows that there isn’t just one version of a “running quarterback.” Each one can bring a unique style. And in today’s NFL, those differences matter just as much as arm strength or accuracy.\n\n\nCode\nTop5TD &lt;- TopYA |&gt;\n  group_by(Team, Player) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    RushingYardAttempts = sum(`Y/A`),\n    RushingTouchdowns = sum(TD)\n  )\n\nChartTD &lt;- Top5TD |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"Rushing\"),\n    names_to=\"Type\",\n    values_to=\"Yards\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=ChartTD, aes(x=Player, weight=Yards, fill=Type), color=\"black\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"red\",\"grey\")) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"The NFL's Most Dangerous Running QBs\",\n    subtitle=\"These five quarterbacks aren't just scrambling to get the ball somewhere. They're putting massive rushing \\nattempts and finding the end zone, making defenses pay when they take off with the ball.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Shaylin Kucera\",\n    x= \"\", \n    y= \"\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size=11),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking across all the data from the 2024 season, it’s clear that running doesn’t magically make someone a better quarterback, but it definitely adds something valuable. When a quarterback can consistently move the ball across the field, it changes how defenses play, opens up the offense, and gives their team another way to win. Some quarterbacks rely on speed and creativity, others use power or timing, and a few blend it all together. What stood out is how these rushing traits connect to bigger trends like more attempts often come with more responsibility, efficiency can swing week to week, and the quarterbacks who balance smart decision-making with athletic ability tend to make the biggest impact. In the end, running isn’t the only thing that makes a great quarterback, but in today’s NFL, it’s becoming a huge part of what makes many of them so dangerous."
